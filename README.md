Multi-Agent ReAct AI System for Automated Security Vulnerability Detection

 Multi-agent ReAct AI system using LangChain and LangGraph that automatically detects security vulnerabilities in GitHub repositories, leverages open-source CVE APIs, generates code fixes, and creates pull requests with security improvements.

System Architecture Overview
The proposed system follows a supervisor multi-agent architecture where a central supervisor agent orchestrates specialized worker agents to perform distinct security analysis tasks. This hierarchical design ensures efficient task delegation, clear separation of concerns, and robust coordination between different components of the security analysis pipeline.

The architecture consists of five primary agents working together:
* 	A Supervisor Agent that coordinates the entire workflow,
* 	A Code Scanner Agent for static analysis,
* 	A CVE Detection Agent for vulnerability database matching,
* 	A Fix Generator Agent for automated remediation, and
* 	A PR Creator Agent for repository integration.
* 	Each agent utilizes specialized tools and APIs to perform its designated functions while maintaining clear communication channels through the supervisor.

‚ú® Features:
	‚Ä¢	Scans code for known and potential vulnerabilities
 
	‚Ä¢	Provides detailed reports with severity levels
 
	‚Ä¢	Suggests or applies fixes where possible
 
	‚Ä¢	Supports Python, Shell Script
 
	‚Ä¢	Designed for easy CI/CD integration
 

üöÄ Ideal for: Developers, security engineers, DevSecOps teams

### Technical Implementation Framework

#### Core Framework Components
The implementation uses LangChain and LangGraph as the foundational framework for multi-agent coordination. The supervisor pattern utilizes handoff tools to enable seamless communication between agents, the ReAct framework provides reasoning and action capabilities for decision-making. State management through MessagesState ensures consistent information flow across the entire system.

#### Code Analysis Technologies
Static code analysis uses multiple technologies including Python's AST module for syntax tree parsing, Tree-sitter for incremental parsing, and specialized security tools like Bandit and Semgrep. The system supports multi-language analysis through configurable parsers and implements custom security rules for different vulnerability types.

#### API Integration Strategy
External API integration uses the NVD 2.0 API for official CVE data, VulnCheck Community API for enhanced vulnerability information, and GitHub API for repository management.
